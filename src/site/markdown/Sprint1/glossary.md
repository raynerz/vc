## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide standardized glossary to be used by IT professionals in involved Business Analysis and Requirement Engineering to ensure common understanding of basic terms and activities.

****
###A

**Application** is a software running the programmed code.

###C

**Cache** is a software component or memory allocation that stores data for quick reference and utilization by the software/application to facilitate computation or data retrieval.

**compiler** is a software program that transforms high-level source code that is written by a developer in a high-level programming languages into a low level object code (binary code) in machine language.

**Client** also known as host is the computer with which the server will be communicating/interacting with for data retrieval, manipulation and display.

**Crash** is the improper behavior of the software thus resulting in lagging, shutdown or frozen screens.

**CRM** also known as *Customer Relationship Management*, manages doctors and patients' histories. It also controls the device through the data logger.

###D

**Database** stores doctors accounts and patients records.

**Datalogger** Receives information from the device and writes it to the database.

**Debug** is the process of finding the cause of software malfuntionality and solving it.

**Debugging** is the action of determining the cause of software malfunctionality and resolving the issue.

**Dependency/ies** are imported requirements which are needed for the proper running of the project.

**Device** measures the temperature of patients and returns data to the datalogger.

###F

**File** is usually in a format that is known only to the program where the information can be in binary or readable format. These usually have ```.txt, .dat, .java, .class, .xml``` extension at the end to define their default readable encryption to the computer.

**Folder** can be described as a container for the files for orgranization and facilitate access.

###G

**Git** is a platform which can be accessed through the command line or GUI allowing developers to ```push```, ```pull```, ```merge``` or ```rebase``` their code together.

**GitLab** is a platform used sharing different parts of the project allowing multiple developers to work alongside each other and in the end ```merge``` everything together to meet the deadline faster.

**GUI** is a shorthand for *Graphical User Interface* whom sole purpose is to display information and facilitate user-interaction with data wether for creating, modifying and deleting.

###H

**Host** also known as the client is where the software will be running. For a more accurate description, please see *Client*.

###M

**Maven** is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project. It standardizes the project implementations especially when working with multiple people. Is usually used in combination with other commands in the terminal, for example ```mvn clean package site```.

**merge** is the process used on *Git* or *GitLab* to add different part of a project into one.

###I

**IDE** shorthand-form for *Integrated Development Environment* is a general term use to talk about a  programming editor used for development.

**Intelli J IDEA Community Edition** also known as *IntelliJ IDEA Community* is the IDE used for application development in Java SDK 11.

**Internet**

###J
**JaCoCo** which stands for *Java Code Coverage* is a tool that monitors the testing percentage. With Jacoco it is possible to monitor what are the methods that have been tested.

**Java SDK 11** is the programming language used for the development of the software/appication. It has integrated developer tools facilitating the development process.

**JRE 11** is shorthand for *Java Runtime Environment 11* which is installed on the host computer for the software to run on.

**Junit 5** is the next generation of the Junit framework which is used for testing methods and that the correct functionalities and results are obtained.

**JVM** shorthand for *Java Virtual Machine* is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode. (source Wikipedia)

###L

**Lagging** takes place when data retrieval and display takes longer than expected thus providing a bad user experience.

###P

**plugin/s** is/are third-party software component that adds specific feature/s to an existing computer program.

**Polling** or polled operation, in computer science, refers to actively sampling the status of an external device by a client program as a synchronous activity. Polling is most often used in terms of input/output (I/O), and is also referred to as polled I/O or software-driven I/O. (source: wikipedia)

**pom-file** is a maven file containing all the specifications and requirements for the project.
